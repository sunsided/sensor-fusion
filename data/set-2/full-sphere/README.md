===========

These are measurements of a **rotating system** where a rotation around the center point is made. 

    Z
    |  Y
    | /
    |/______X

The rough order is:

1. around Z'up
2. around X'forward
3. around Y'left
4. tilt right, around Y'up
5. around Z'right
6. tilt right, around Z'down
7. tilt right, around Z'left
8. around Y'down
9. around X'back
